        <h1>Creating Grammarly from scratch</h1>
        <hr>
        <p class="small">
            Disclaimer: This Grammarly replica is built in Danish. The exact modules built here will be specific to Danish,
            but the methodology and implementation should not be specific to the language.
        </p>

            To my knowledge, no one has tried to create a complete replica of Grammarly in another language and document 
            the process for others to learn from. I couldn't find anyone at least. So I decided to try this out myself.
            It's not easy, but definetely possible to get it to a stable and valuable state.

            This will be a long post. I tried to divide into chapters as much as possible. Read what you need, skip what 
            does not interest you. Here we go.

            0. The idea
        </h3>
        <p>
            Building a complete replica of Grammarly is not possible and should not be the goal. What I find interesting is
            trying to rebuild the core functionality to get an idea of how it works. So the main goal here is to figure out how to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make simple checkers to help out with spellchecking, simple grammar rules and punctuation</li>
            <li>Build a bigger model to tackle some problem better (either spellchecking, punctuation or something else)</li>
            <li>Hook everything up to work on the web & cloud</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
